# MemeveyPro-m68k
Basically, a giant playground for me to play with Retro68.

## Prerequisites.
MemeveyPro-m68k requires Retro68 to compile. If you're having trouble getting it to compile, try using the --no-ppc option.

Systems earlier than System 6 will not be targets, though this may work on Systems earlier than 6.

If you want to run this program, use BasiliskII or (preferably the Macintosh II version of) MiniVMac.
